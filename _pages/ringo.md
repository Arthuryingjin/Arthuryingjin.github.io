RINGO firstly propose a real-time navigation framework for aerial manipulators navigation in unknown environments.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Navigation**: Enables aerial manipulators to navigate through unknown environments in real time
- **Guiding Trajectory**: Any B-spline parameterized trajectory can serve as the guidance trajectory
- **Workspace Constraint**: Utilizes the convex-hull property to incorporate the workspace constraint
